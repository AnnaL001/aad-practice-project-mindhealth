# MindHealth
A mobile application enabling access to mental healthcare services such as individual, couples and group therapy via video-based and text-based sessions

**Development to continue soon**

#### By **[Lynn Nyangon](https://github.com/AnnaL001)**

## Description
### "I need therapy" user journey<br>
Currently, the existing features comprise of authentication(login & signup), capturing assessment responses and displaying them to the user and fetching a filtered list of therapists from the database based on the captured assessment responses, from which a user selects a therapist of their preferred choice. A user can also input personal information such as a profile photo, their name and phone number. Aside from that, there are different screen designs for the dark mode and light mode.<br>

The remaining features include selection of a therapist, the ability to switch a therapist, viewing a therapist's profile before selecting one, viewing one's selected therapist's profile, addition of video and text-based sessions for individual, group and couples therapy and the implementation of the settings page.
